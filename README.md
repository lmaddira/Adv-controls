### Overview
This  paper  presents  the  work  done  on  designingand  implementing  a  nonlinear  model  predictive  control  (MPC)based  controller  on  a  self-balancing  two  wheeled  mobile  robotfor a dynamic environment. The inverted pendulum model usedin  this  study  is  naturally  an  unstable  system  when  subjected  tonatural  disturbances  due  to  environmental  loading  conditions.This  model  has  been  studied  extensively  in  the  past  for  PDcontrollers  but  MPC  has  been  relatively  left  unexplored.  Inthis   paper   we   propose   various   controllers,   PD   controller,MPC   controller   as   feedback   and   MPC   reference   trackingfeed  forward  controller  with  a  inner  PD  controller,  to  drivethe  balancing  two  wheeled  robot  in  a  dynamic  environment.Simulation  results  demonstrate  the  feasibility  and  efficiency  ofour  proposed  design  and  experimental  results  on  the  hardwarevalidate the these results. A follower robot and obstacle detectionwas  added  in  the  final  demonstration  to  show  multi  roboticsinteraction.The  PD  controller  with  live  camera  feedback  wasable  to  demonstatet  robust  line  tracking,  obstacle  detection  andmulti-robot   interaction.The   MPC   based   self   balancing   robotwas  able  to  track  a  straight  line  with  full  state  feedback.

### Arduino
#### 1. Manual_line_track.ino
  (Please upload Manual_line_track_slave.ino to the slave Nano first)
  (Upload Manual_line_track.ino to the master Nano. Set up hotspot on a mobile phone. On laptop open Putty and connect to the Raspberry Pi over the hotspot. This will open up     mini-com which the user can use to give manual commands.)
  There are two possible modes of operation of the robot.
  ##### 1.1. Manual Mode 
        When switched on for the first time, robot boots up in the manual mode. If in correction mode press 'M' or 'm' to switch to manual mode. 
        In this mode the robot moves as follows:
        1.1.a. Press 'W' or 'w' to move the robot forward.
        1.1.b. Press 'S' or 's' to move the robot in reverse.
        1.1.c. Press 'A' or 'a' to turn the robot left in its current position.
        1.1.d. Press 'D' or 'd' to turn the robot right in its current position.
        1.1.e. Press 'Q' or 'q' to balance the robot in its current position.
  ##### 1.2. Correction Mode (fully autonomous)
        Press 'C' or 'c' to switch from manual mode to correction mode. 
        In this mode, the user looses manual control of the robot. The user can only press 'M' or 'm' to switch back to manual mode.
        To run the robot in this mode, user will have to define a path on the ground with a tape (Dark tape on a light ground). The ground should not have any other lines or             patterns which could interfere with the Pixy's line tracking algorithm.
        Once setup is done, the robot will automatically track the line using reading obtained by the Pixy.
        
#### 2. Manual_line_track_slave.ino
    Upload this to the slave Nano when running Manual_line_track.ino in the master. This will send the x coordinate of the vector that is being tracked by the Pixy to the           master. This code only comes into play when user is running the robot in Correction mode. 
        
#### 3. MPC.ino
    (Open MPC_robot_square_wave.mlx in MATLAB on a computer)
    This code will send currently calculated states to MATLAB running on a computer. MATLAB will then send the reference velocities to the master. 
    This mode is also fully autonomous where user cannot interact with the ino.
   
The MPC mode is setup to take a reference velocity from the MATLAB script and track it using inner PI controller for velocity. The balancing is achieved using a PD control for tilt. The MATLAB script reads the states from the serial device (Raspberry Pi) and is fed as the start-point of the MPC formulation. Based on this and the reference square wave velocity it has to track, the MPC is formulated such that it provides the reference velocity while ensuring constraints on control effort [-12,12]V and maximum tilt angle. 

### Conclusions
In conclusion the Tumbller was able to balance and followlines  with  a  PD  controller  effectively.  For  the  final  demothe  team  was  able  to  incorporate  obstacle  detection  and  afollower  robot.  In  terms  of  MPC  the  robot  was  able  to  tracka  line  of  fixed  distance.  Full  robot  MPC  was  not  achieveddue  to  the  communication  delays  encountered  in  parsing  theincoming data stream. From the limited testing performed dueto restricted on campus access the robot had a wide range offunctionality.  This  aligned  with  the  teamâ€™s  goal  of  making  ascaled  version  of  a  self  balancing  multi-agent  robot  systemthat is able to function in as an automated guided vehicle.

### Future work
In retrospect, based on the communication delays observedin  running  the  paring  scripts  on  MATLAB,  the  controllerwould  have  been  better  implemented  if  run  locally  on  theRaspberry Pi either through MATLAB or an embedded scriptderived from MATLAB Coder. By generating C and C++ codefor the Raspberry Pi platform along with libraries for the IMUand Tumbller source code, a standalone version of the programcould be generated.
